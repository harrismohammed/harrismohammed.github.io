As a fan of Football, the heated atmosphere enveloping the stadium packed with fans(EPL houses on an average of 38,297 people ) from all over the world to support their club/team by singing phrases in unision to motivate the team, Shouting in joy when a Goal is scored or When the Goalkeeper saves a stunner or Even sometimes a Nail biting finish to win the league and secure the title (AAAAGGGUUUEEERRROOO !!! ) can run chills down the spine. It's more than a game, its a part of the Family to many!!
